Kotlin Kydra Log - Kotlin Multiplatform Library that allows to write logs in common module. The way how logs will written defines for each platform independently.

Fully supported platforms:
- Android and AndroidNative(Arm32, Arm64, X64, X86) using LogCat;
- JavaScript using JS Console;
- Apple based: iOS, MacOS, Watch and TV using NSLog.

Also, not well by using `println` with timestamp:
- Java;
- Linux based: X64, Arm64, Arm32Hfp, Mips32 and Mipsel32;
- Windows X64 and X86;
- WebAssembly without timestamp.

### How to use:
Add common library as dependency in common **`build.gradle`**:
```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'ru.pocketbyte.kydra:kydra-log:1.0.3'
}
```

Then you able to use KydraLog in common code:
```Kotlin
KydraLog.info("Info log message")
KydraLog.debug("Debug log message")
KydraLog.warn("Warning log message")
KydraLog.error("Error log message")
```
### Logging with format:
If you would to log formatted string you should use kotlin String Templates:
```Kotlin
val count = 1
KydraLog.info("Count is $count")
```
To optimize logging with formatting you could use methods with function as parameter instead of string. It allow to skip filtered messages without calculating message string.
```Kotlin
KydraLog.info { "Count is $count" }
```
Here is the complex example that demonstrate logging of function.
```Kotlin
// Messages with level priority that lower than INFO will be filtered
KydraLog.initDefault(level= LogLevel.INFO)

var loggerMessage = "Hello"
KydraLog.error {
    loggerMessage = "Hello from Error"
    "Error log printed"
}
KydraLog.debug {
    loggerMessage = "Hello from Debug"
    "Debug log printed"
}
KydraLog.info { "Logger say: $loggerMessage" }
```
In the logs will be printed following list of messages:
```
Error log printed
Logger say: Hello from Error
```
### Logger initialization:
Any logging via not initialized KydraLog will call initialisation with default Logger. But if you want to initialize `KydraLog` with custom filtering you could use function `initDefault(level: LogLevel?, tags: Set<String?>?)`.
For example, on Android platform can be used different `LogLevel` filtering depending on build type:
```Kotlin
calss MyApplication: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        if (!BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
            // No need to write debug logs in production build
            KydraLog.initDefault(LogLevel.INFO)
        }
    }
}
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Initialization can be called only once. Re-initialization will throw `IllegalStateException`. Any logging via not initialized KydraLog will call initialisation with default Logger.

### Custom loggers:
If you want to implement your own custom logger you should implement interface **`ru.pocketbyte.kydra.log.Logger`**:

```Kotlin
class MyLogger: Logger {

    override fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, message: String) {
        // Custom logging of message
        ...
    }

    fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, exception: Throwable) {
        // Custom logging of exception
        ...
    }

    fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, function: () -> String) {
        // Custom logging of function

        // For example
        log(level, tag, function())
    }
}
```

Then you should init KydraLog with your logger:

```Kotlin
KydraLog.init(MyLogger())
```
To apply filter on your custom logger you could use operator `filtered`:
```Kotlin
// Will loged only error logs with tags "API_CORE" and "API_SOCKET"
KydraLog.init(MyLogger().filtered(LogLevel.ERROR, setOf("API_CORE", "API_SOCKET")))
```

To utilize several loggers at the same time could be used `LoggersSet`:
```Kotlin
KydraLog.init(
    LoggersSet(
        AndroidLogger(),
        MyLogger().filtered(LogLevel.ERROR, setOf("API_CORE", "API_SOCKET"))
    ).filtered(if(BuildConfig.DEBUG) LogLevel.DEBUG  else LogLevel.INFO)
)
```
**Note:** In example above, second filter applies to whole set instead of applying to `AndroidLogger` only. It helps to optimize logging with functions that was described in section "Logging with format", because `LoggersSet` calculate function and pass it's result into method `log(level, tag, message)` of wrapped loggers.

### KydraLog class is not mandatory:
You are not forced to use `KydraLog` object. It was designed to provide Plug and Play functionality. If you wish, you can instantiate `Logger` as variable and use it for logging. Or you can use Dependency Injection to provide `Logger` instance. To make sure that `KydraLog` is not used in your application you can init `KydraLog` with `ThrowExceptionLogger`:
```Kotlin
// BuildConfig is an example class from android platform.
// You should use corresponded way to identify debug build for each platform independently.
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    KydraLog.init(ThrowExceptionLogger("KydraLog object is forbidden. Please use DI to get Logger instance."))
} else {
    // No need to crash Production Build
    KydraLog.initDefault()
}
```
It will let other developers to know that they should use another way to get an instance of `Logger`.
