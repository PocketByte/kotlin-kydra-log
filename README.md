# Kotlin Hydra Log
Kotlin Hydra Log - Kotlin Multiplatform Library that allows to write logs in common module. The way how logs will written defines for each platform independently.

##### How to use in Common module:
First add common library as dependency in common **`build.gradle`**:
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'ru.pocketbyte.hydra.log:hydra-log-common:0.1.1'
}
```
Then you able to use HydraLog in common code:
```Kotlin
HydraLog.debug("TEST_TAG", "Debug log message")
HydraLog.info("TEST_TAG", "Info log message")
```

##### How to use in Android module:
To make it work in Android add following dependency into Android **`build.gradle`**:
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'ru.pocketbyte.hydra.log:hydra-log-android:0.1.1'
}
```
Then init HydraLog in Application class:
```Kotlin
class MyApplication: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        HydraLog.initDefault()
    }
}
```

##### How to use in iOS module:
To make it work in iOS add following dependency into iOS **`build.gradle`**:
```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'ru.pocketbyte.hydra.log:hydra-log-ios:0.1.1'
}
```
No need to init HydraLog as it was done for Android, iOS library will do it automatically.

##### Custom loggers:
If you want to implement your own custom logger you should implement interface **`ru.pocketbyte.hydra.log.Logger`**:
```Kotlin
class MyLogger: Logger {

    override fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, message: String, vararg arguments: Any) {
        // Custom logging of message
        ...
    }

    fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, exception: Throwable) {
        // Custom logging of exception
        ...
    }

    fun log(level: LogLevel, tag: String?, function: () -> String) {
        // Custom logging of function

        // For example
        log(level, tag, function())
    }
}
```
Then you should init HydraLog with your logger:
```Kotlin
HydraLog.init(MyLogger())
```
